This project is a web app that allows the user to make lists of reminders such as a grocery list. They can add, edit, and delete reminders on those lists. Users can also set a due date and a priority for their reminders.
This web app utilizes the browsers localStorage functionality so that any list the user makes is saved even if they leave the site and it is available when they return.
